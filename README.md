# A 2D Pong game with multi-directional pings and pongs with speed adjusting to player input
This game is aimed to mimic the Pong game that "Lillan" plays on her laptop. 
Having trapped the two castle ghosts, Jean and Staffan, in her computer by printer-functionality only available during the 90's, this epic game of pong was meant to be played for as short time as possible.
My first undertaking of working with the Godot engine.
